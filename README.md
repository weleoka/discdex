Indexing for CD/DVD/HDD

A simple tool to create a log of all files and folders on a media device such as a CD or BLU-Ray. The log appends an arbitary name to all files/folders which specifies which CD/BR it can be found on.

## Issues
If there are files that are not in a subdir the listing needs to take into account them. This first version of the program only lists files found in a subdir.
